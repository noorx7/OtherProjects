Project 4  - Imdb Movie App

My most exciting project till date. This project taught me alot about web development and was ground zero to web development for me. In this project me and another team mate took on challenges such as extracting data from csv files and populating a database which in turn is used to populate our app. Authentication such as JWT Tokens, special auth's for admins. Stripe integration to make a fully functioning buy/rent market. Mocha.js to run tests to make sure everything worked as normal before pushing new code (Saved us a lot of headaches). Overall a super fun project that was built from scratch with the MERN stack and helped me get a good footing in Web Development.
