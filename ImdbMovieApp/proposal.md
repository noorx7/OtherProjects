### Brief explanation about our Project



 My team decided to make a website that pulls information from the IMDb database. Our project will contain several web pages, an index page, a login page, my profile page, etc.

You will be able to create an account and choose a movie, then all kinds of information about the movie will show up, you will also be able to add movies to your favorite page.
